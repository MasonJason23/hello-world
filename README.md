### About
AboutAbout
I am currently in my 4th year at CSUMB and I am looking for beginner-level opportunities in the video game development industry/software engineering industry. Game development is a field I am passionate about and despite some lack of knowledge in the video game industry, I would love to create something that makes players have fun and be immersed. I am an aspiring student that is willing to gain more connections to achieve a video game development career that will require computer science skills. Prepared to start from a beginner-level employee and gain experience pressing forward.

### "Hello World" Origin Story
"Where exactly did Hello World originate? Itâ€™s creator, Brian Kernighan, authored one of the most widely read programming books, C Programming Language. He first referenced Hello World in his book titled A Tutorial Introduction to the Programming Language B. And while no one can scientifically explain why it became so wildly popular, the program marks a major change in the historical rhetoric of programming itself." - [source](https://blogs.vmware.com/opensource/2020/04/22/hello-world-timeless-code/#:~:text=Where%20exactly%20did%20Hello%20World,to%20the%20Programming%20Language%20B.)
